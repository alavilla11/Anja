I have been studying in MITIS for 12 years now. I started off as a kindergardener, the first ever kindergardener of MIT, now a grade 11 student. I basically have spent more time in school than my home. </p>

<p>
Every year seems to get more challenging and challenging. As expected the higher grade you are the harder the subjects, but I didnt realize the longer I am in school the longer life gets difficult too. I have learned so much and met so much people. I have made so much friends, some left, some stayed. As I grow up in this school, I slowly got to know more about myself, my goals, and my priorities.</p> 

<p>
Despite the challenges, I have learned to move on and accept reality. I know that I'm not alone and I'm not the only one experiencing these challenges. I am grateful for all the good and bad days in school. To the kidergarden me, I hope I've made her proud. </p>
